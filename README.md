# TCP/IP Chatroom

The TCP/IP Chatroom is a chat application built using Python and the TCP/IP protocol suite, enabling real-time communication over a network.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication:** Developed a TCP/IP chat room enabling real-time communication between multiple users.
- **Concurrent Connections:** Ensured efficient handling of concurrent connections using threading, allowing multiple users to chat simultaneously without delays.
- **Activity Logging:** Logs all client activity, including chat messages, for future reference and analysis.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Networking Protocol:** TCP/IP
- **Socket Programming:** Utilized socket programming for establishing network connections and communication.

## Usage

1. **Server Setup:**
   - Run the server script (`server.py`) on a computer that acts as the host.
   - Specify the server IP address and port number (default port is 5000).

2. **Client Connection:**
   - Run the client script (`client.py`) on each user's computer.
   - Provide the server IP address and port number to connect to the chatroom.

3. **Chatting:**
   - Start typing messages in the client's interface to send messages to other users in the chatroom.
   - Receive incoming messages in real-time from other users connected to the server.
